            <h3>ingredients</h3>    
            <ul>
                <li>Cooked white rice</li>
                <li>Large eggs</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Scallions </li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and ground white pepper</li>
                <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If using freshly cooked rice, spread it on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to dry out and cool completely; this prevents mushiness</li>
                <li>Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) of oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of the rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until pale brown and toasted with a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and the remaining rice.</li>
                <li>Return the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic, and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Push the rice to the side of the wok and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break the eggs into the oil and season with a little salt</li>
                <li>Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until the peas are thawed and every grain of rice is separate</li>
